Car Price Prediction using Cardekho Dataset from Kaggle. <b>(Guide Project From Krish Naik Youtube Channel)</b><br><br>
<b>About Project</b>
<p>The prices of new cars in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. So, customers buying a new car can be assured of the money they invest to be worthy. But due to the increased price of new cars and the incapability of majority of customers to buy new cars due to the lack of funds, demand for used cars has increased in India.<br><br>
There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features. Even though there are websites that offers this service, their prediction method may or may not be the best. Besides, different models and systems may contribute on predicting power for a used carâ€™s actual market value. It is important to know their actual market value while both buying and selling.<br><br>
So during my learning phase i decided to create a simple car price prediction model and used hyperparameter tuning to make it as accurate as possible by implementing Decision Tree Algorithm's</p>
